								<h2>Description</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>
								The One Health movement aims to highlight the limitless overlap between human and animal health, as well as the importance of the health of the environment they share. The One Health concept covers topics including infectious, emerging and zoonotic disease, pharmaceutical development, climate change, specie diversity, mental health, translational or comparative medicine, food safety, food security and many more topics...!
							</p>
							<p>
								
								We understand that no single expertise will single-handedly be able to rise to the challenges facing global health in the coming generations. One Health is a concept that requires the input of all those interested in improving health (of humans, animals and the environment) to succeed in changing the way we think and act about health and medicine.
							</p>
							<p>
								
								The medical, veterinary and scientific research communities, international development agencies, environmentalists, conservationists, engineers, policy makers and other disciplines can all bring valuable knowledge and expertise to the One Health table. It is essential that the next generation of One Health professionals are able to meet and develop these ideas together. Networking is key to ensuring the exchange, debate and development of ideas. 
							</p>
							<p>
								With this in mind, the <em>annual Cambridge One Health Conference</em> was started with the aim of inviting professionals from a variety of disciplines to discuss One Health topics and share their knowledge and experiences with the student community. The conference is open to <em>anyone</em> who is interested in the One Health concept.
							</p>
							<p>
								Following the successes of the first two Cambridge One Health Conferences in January 2014 and January 2015, we are delighted to announce that the next conference will be held in <strong>early 2016 (date TBC) </strong>at Cambridge University, UK.
