								<h2>Description</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>
								The One Health movement highlights the limitless overlap between human and animal health as well as the importance of the health of the environment they share, covering topics including infectious or zoonotic diseases, pharmaceutical development, climate change, specie diversity, mental health, food safety and food security. 
							</p>
							<p>
								
								We passionately believe that no single expertise will single-handedly be able to rise to the challenges facing global health in the coming generations. One Health is a concept that requires the input of those interested in all aspects of life on earth to succeed in changing the way we think and act about health and medicine.
							</p>
							<p>
								
								The medical, veterinary and scientific research communities, international development agencies, environmentalists and conservationists can all provide invaluable knowledge and experience in their respective fields. It is essential that the next generation of One Health professionals are able to meet and develop these ideas together. With this in mind, the Cambridge One Health Conference aims to invite prominent speakers highly regarded in the international community to discuss One Health topics and share their knowledge and expertise with the student community. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Following the success of the first Cambridge One Health Conference last year, we are delighted to announce that the next conference will be held on <strong>Saturday 17th January, 2015 </strong>at Cambridge University, UK.  
							</p>
